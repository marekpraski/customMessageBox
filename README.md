# customMessageBox
C# replace the built-in VS MessageBox. 
for reasons I cannot recall the built-in MessageBox did not do what I wanted it to so I ended up writing my own. 
It has the potencial for as many buttons as may reasonably be needed (rigth now there are two programmed). 
Just import the three MyMessageBox files into your project, change the namespace and it should work.
